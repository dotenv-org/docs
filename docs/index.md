# Welcome to dotenv âœ¨

Dotenv is the worldwide standard for securing environment variables. In these docs, you'll learn how it works and how Dotenv Vault works.

Dotenv secures your environment variables locally and Dotenv Vault secures them across your team and infrastructure.

Dotenv is 100% open source and free to use. Dotenv Vault is a hybrid open source service (similar to GitHub). It is free to use for individuals and for teams up to 3 people.

More than 1,000,000 developers use and trust Dotenv. It has a long and proven track record of security. Dotenv Vault is new (74183d4 Mar 2022) but is growing rapidly. Over 3,000 developers and startups already trust and use Dotenv Vault.

Anyways, that's enough about that. Let's get you started!
