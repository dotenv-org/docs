The secrets manager for .env files – from the same people that pioneered dotenv. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Sync your .env files with a single command, deploy them with an encrypted .env.vault file, and say goodbye to scattered secrets across multiple platforms and tools.

If you already use .env files you can benefit from dotenv-vault in just a few seconds of your time. It works with a single command:

```bash
npx dotenv-vault@latest push
```
